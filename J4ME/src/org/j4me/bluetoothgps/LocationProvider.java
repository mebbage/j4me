/**
 * This is the starting point for applications using this API and represents a
 * source of the location information. A <code>LocationProvider</code> represents a
 * location-providing module, generating <code>Location</code>s.
 * <p>
 * Applications obtain <code>LocationProvider</code> instances (classes implementing
 * the actual functionality by extending this abstract class) by calling the
 * factory method. It is the responsibility of the implementation to return the
 * correct <code>LocationProvider</code>-derived object.
 * <p>
 * Applications that need to specify criteria for the location provider
 * selection, must first create a <code>Criteria</code> object, and pass it to the
 * factory method. The methods that access the location related information
 * shall throw <code>SecurityException</code> if the application does not have the
 * relevant permission to access the location information.
 * <p>
 * A typical implementation will get a list of Bluetooth devices and let
 * the user select their GPS device.  Then it will persist that address using
 * the J2ME Record Management System (RMS) for the future.  Once the address
 * is known, we can use that as criteria for selecting the GPS device.  The
 * following demonstrates how to do this (note it is a lengthy operation and
 * should be handled appropriately such as on a different thread):
 * <code><pre>
 * 	// Create our location criteria assuming the hosting device has it.
 * 	Criteria criteria = new Criteria();
 * 	criteria.setHorizontalAccuracy( 1 );  // +/- 1 meter 68.27% of the time
 * 	// [Set other criteria here]
 * 
 * 	// See if anything matches on the local device.
 * 	LocationProvider provider = LocationProvider.getInstance( criteria );
 * 
 * 	// Is there a LBS on the local device?
 * 	if ( provider == null )  // then nothing on local device
 * 	{
 * 		// Get the Bluetooth devices within 10 meters that are accepting
 *		// connections.  This can take 10 seconds or more.
 * 		String[][] remoteDevices = LocationProvider.discoverRemoteDevices();
 * 
 * 		if ( remoteDevices == null )
 * 		{
 * 			return;
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		// Show the user a list of devices by the human readable names.
 * 		String[] deviceNames = new String[remoteDevices.length];
 * 
 * 		for ( int i = 0; i < remoteDevices.length; i++ )
 * 		{
 * 			deviceNames[i] = remoteDevices[i][0];
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		// [Show the list here and set an integer deviceIndex to it]
 * 
 * 		// Get the Bluetooth address of the device.
 * 		String address = remoteDevices[deviceIndex][1];
 * 
 *		// [Store the device's name and address for next time]
 *
 *		// See if the remote device will work.
 *		criteria.setRemoteDeviceAddress( address );
 *		provider = LocationProvider.getInstance( criteria );
 *	}

	 * This factory method is used to get an actual <code>LocationProvider</code>

	 * are out of service.
	 * <p>
	 * A <code>LocationProvider</code> instance is returned if there is a location
	 * provider meeting the criteria in either the available or temporarily
	 * unavailable state. Implementations should try to select providers in the
	 * available state before providers in temporarily unavailable state, but
	 * this can't be always guaranteed because the implementation may not always
	 * know the state correctly at this point in time. If a <code>LocationProvider</code>
	 * meeting the criteria can be supported but is currently out of service, it
	 * shall not be returned.
	 * <p>
	 * When this method is called with a <code>Criteria</code> that has all fields
	 * set to the default values (i.e. the least restrictive criteria possible),
	 * the implementation shall return a <code>LocationProvider</code> if there is
	 * any provider that isn't in the out of service state. Passing <code>null</code>
	 * as the parameter is equal to passing a <code>Criteria</code> that has all
	 * fields set to the default values, i.e. the least restrictive set of
	 * criteria.
	 * <p>
	 * This method only makes the selection of the provider based on the
	 * criteria and is intended to return it quickly to the application. Any

	 * <p>
	 * Passing in -1 as the interval selects the default interval which is
	 * dependent on the used location method. Passing in 0 as the interval
	 * registers the listener to only receive provider status updates and not
	 * location updates at all.
	 * <p>
	 * Only one listener can be registered with each <code>LocationProvider</code>
	 * instance. Setting the listener replaces any possibly previously set
	 * listener. Setting the listener to <code>null</code> cancels the registration
	 * of any previously set listener.
	 * <p>
	 * The implementation shall initiate obtaining the first location result

	 * the listener as soon as it is available. Subsequent location updates will
	 * happen at the defined interval after the first one. If the specified
	 * update interval is smaller than the time it takes to obtain the first
	 * result, the listener shall receive location updates with invalid
	 * Locations at the defined interval until the first location result is
	 * available.
	 * <p>
	 * The timeout parameter determines a timeout that is used if it's not
	 * possible to obtain a new location result when the update is scheduled to
	 * be provided. This timeout value indicates how many seconds the update is
	 * allowed to be provided late compared to the defined interval. If it's not
	 * possible to get a new location result (interval + timeout) seconds after
	 * the previous update, the update will be made and an invalid <code>Location</code>
	 * instance is returned. This is also done if the reason for the inability
	 * to obtain a new location result is due to the provider being temporarily
	 * unavailable or out of service. For example, if the interval is 60 seconds
	 * and the timeout is 10 seconds, the update must be delivered at most 70
	 * seconds after the previous update and if no new location result is
	 * available by that time the update will be made with an invalid
	 * <code>Location</code> instance.
	 * <p>
	 * The <code>maxAge</code> parameter defines how old the location result is
	 * allowed to be provided when the update is made. This allows the
	 * implementation to reuse location results if it has a recent location
	 * result when the update is due to be delivered. This parameter can only be
	 * used to indicate a larger value than the normal time of obtaining a
	 * location result by a location method. The normal time of obtaining the
	 * location result means the time it takes normally to obtain the result
	 * when a request is made. If the application specifies a time value that is
	 * less than what can be realized with the used location method, the
	 * implementation shall provide as recent location results as are possible
	 * with the used location method. For example, if the interval is 60
	 * seconds, the <code>maxAge</code> is 20 seconds and normal time to obtain the
	 * result is 10 seconds, the implementation would normally start obtaining
	 * the result 50 seconds after the previous update. If there is a location
	 * result otherwise available that is more recent than 40 seconds after the
	 * previous update, then the <code>maxAge</code> setting to 20 seconds allows to
	 * return this result and not start obtaining a new one.
	 * 
	 * @param locationlistener - the listener to be registered. If set to <code>null</code>
	 *        the registration of any previously set listener is cancelled.
	 * @param interval - the interval in seconds. -1 is used for the default
	 *        interval of this provider. 0 is used to indicate that the
	 *        application wants to receive only provider status updates and not
	 *        location updates at all.
	 * @param timeout - timeout value in seconds, must be greater than 0. if the

	 *        parameter has no effect and the default timeout for this provider
	 *        is used. If the interval is 0, this parameter has no effect.
	 * @param maxAge - maximum age of the returned location in seconds, must be
	 *        greater than 0 or equal to -1 to indicate that the default maximum
