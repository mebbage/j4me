/**
 * The <code>DeviceScreen</code> class is a base class for any screen that needs complete
 * control over how it is painted.  It is based on and similar to the MIDP
 * <code>Canvas</code> class.
 * <p>
 * This class removes the following methods from the MIDP <code>Canvas</code> class:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><code>isDoubleBuffered</code> - This class is always double buffered.
 *  <li><code>hasPointerEvents</code> and <code>hasPointerMotionEvents</code> - There is
 *      no use for this method.  Implement the pointer event methods and
 *      if the device has no pointer they will be ignored.  
 *  <li> - Same reason as <code>hasPointerEvents</code>.
 *  <li><code>hasRepeatEvents</code> - This class always has key repeat events.
 *  <li><code>getKeyName</code> - The application should define the names to make them
 *      consistent across all devices.
 *  <li><code>getKeyCode</code> - The key code is passed into the key event methods.
 *  <li><code>getGameAction</code> - The game action is passed into the key event methods.
 *  <li><code>sizeChanged</code> - This method is notoriously buggy and applications
 *      should use <code>getWidth</code> and <code>getHeight</code> instead.
 *  <li><code>getTicker</code> and <code>setTicker</code> - The ticker functionality has
 *      not been implemented.
 *  <li><code>addCommand</code>, <code>removeCommand</code>, and <code>setCommandListener</code> -
 *      Menu options have been replaced with something that works across all
 *      MIDP 2.0 devices.  There are left and right menu options.  See
 *      <code>setMenuText</code> for details.
 * </ul>
