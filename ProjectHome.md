J4ME is an open source library to help build J2ME applications.  It solves many of J2ME's shortcomings including:

| **[UI](UI.md)** that is professional looking and intuitive | ![http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/ProgressBar.png](http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/ProgressBar.png) |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Logging](Logging.md)**, critical for debugging platform-specific problems | ![http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/LogScreen.png](http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/LogScreen.png)     |
| **[GPS](BluetoothGPS.md)** through the device and external Bluetooth pucks | ![http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/GPSDemoScreen.png](http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/GPSDemoScreen.png) |
| **Library** of methods left out of J2ME                    | `double theta = MathFunc.atan2( 1.732050807569, Math.PI );`                                                               |

## Who is it for? ##

J4ME makes development faster and produces better looking applications so it is for nearly everyone.  However it does require MIDP 2.0.  Probably all phones released since 2006 support this.

The J4ME library has been tested on Sun's WTK, IBM's J9, BlackBerry, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and other phones.  One customer has built a [list of supported phones](http://j4me.crickee.net/), but it is incomplete (add yours today!).

J4ME is like [J2ME Polish](http://www.j2mepolish.org/), but is an open source alternative.

## About J4ME ##

The name "J4ME" is a play on J2ME meaning "Java For Me".

It is licensed under the very liberal Apache 2.0 License (similar to the BSD License).  You are free to modify and use the code as you would like, so long as you do not build a golf application.  Although not required please keep the project growing by submitting your code fixes and new functionality.

[![](http://j4me.googlecode.com/svn/website/img/ScoreOutLogo.gif)](http://www.scoreout.com) J4ME was developed by [Score Out](http://www.scoreout.com).  It is the foundation of our mobile application, the [Score Out Caddie](http://www.scoreout.com/products.html#caddie), a GPS yardage guide for golfers.

## Getting Started ##

If you are **new to J2ME** check out our [introduction to J2ME](IntroToJ2ME.md).

To **setup your J2ME environment**, try out J4ME, and build your first J2ME application follow our [Setup Guide](Setup.md).  It will take you about an hour.
